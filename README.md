# DAQ
buffered DAQ

Purpose: build a reliable anolog to digital conversion device with multiple analog inputs to replace the NI DAQ/Labview combination. The device must be compatible with programming languages such as Python, communicate via USB and have sufficient performance and input facilities to replace existing equipment and software used for physics practice college. In preparation are extensions to connect external sensors (measuring humidity, temperature, pressure... with BMP280, DHT22 etc).
